I am a retired  electronics engineer with four decades of association with Semiconductor industry and research. I keep in touch with the latest developments in science and technology  in general and emerging technologies such as Nano Tech in particular, through various news letters and websites. I find impossible to retain and recall such information when needed.  This motivated me to start this blog as a compilation of news I found interesting during my readings. I am hoping it will be an “aide memoire” for me and helps visitors to my blog.
